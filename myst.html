<p>In the mid-2000’s, Cyan Worlds, creators of the massively popular adventure game Myst, released an ambitious online sequel that never caught on the way they'd hoped. Myst Online: Uru Live sought to translate the single-player puzzle-solving experience of the Myst series into a collaborative, massively multiplayer online game. 
</p>

<p>The game had a rocky reception and its online component was compromised from the beginning. It underwent a series of cancellations and relaunches, but in the end it only survived thanks to its dedicated player base. Players carried the game on their backs for years, hacking together fan servers to reimplement much of the online experience the way it was always meant to be. They even formed their own in-game governance structures to improve the player experience. These efforts were so successful that they eventually drew the support of the developers themselves.</p>

<p>We spoke with an ardent member of this player community about his time spent in Uru during its heyday and today.</p>

<h2>Resources</h2>

<ul>
	<li>The Guild of Messengers has a very useful tutorial on <a href="https://guildofmessengers.org/how-to-play/#deepisland" target="_blank">how to start playing Uru today</a>. You can connect to the official Cyan server, or one of a number of "shards" (the community's term for fan servers). We filmed on the Deep Island shard, because it contains the most complete collection of fan-created "ages" (areas). </li>
	<li>It is hilariously difficult to actually access the online part of Uru. In order to do so, you have to clear a long tutorial level, then warp to your "Relto" island (the hub world, basically). From there warp to Gahreesen and pick up a "Ki" there, which will let you talk with other players. You can then use your Ki to access a machine that will list all fan-created ages for you. Here is a <a href="https://www.fisicx.com/uru/walkthrough.htm" target="_blank">walkthrough</a> that will get you most of the way there.</li>
	<li>The Guild of Writers is responsible for creating new Uru ages. They're one of the most active player groups in Uru, and they run the Deep Island shard. They maintain <a href="https://forum.guildofwriters.org/" target="blank">an active forum</a>, and they run weekly expeditions into fan-created ages. They also maintain a helpful <a href="https://guildofwriters.org/wiki/Gallery_of_Fan_Created_Ages" target="_blank">list of fan-created ages</a> with very basic metadat and screenshots.</li>
	<li>The Guild of Archivists run what is essentially a <a href="https://archive.guildofarchivists.org/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank">fan wiki</a> for the Myst series. The section on Uru contains some interesting primary sources related to the ongoing story that the developers advanced over time in the online game, including logs of chats they hosted to advance the story, as well as their in-character forum posts.
