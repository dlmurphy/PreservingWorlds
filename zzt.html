<p>In 1991, 21-year-old game developer Tim Sweeney launched a simplistic, already-outdated MS-DOS game that would become, entirely by accident, the most popular hobbyist game development tool of the 90’s.</p>

<p>ZZT's free, robust, and easy to use level editor allowed players with no money or programming experience to create their own complete, easily sharable games. A large and enthusiastic community blossomed, and today there is a vibrant kaleidoscope of ZZT games out there.</p>

<p>We spoke with Dr. Dos, the proprietor of the <a href="https://museumofzzt.com/" target="_blank">Museum of ZZT</a> website, where he documents, preserves, and makes available a vast collection of user-created ZZT games from the community’s storied history to ensure that they can be enjoyed and studied for years to come.</p>

<h2>Resources</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://museumofzzt.com/" target="_blank">The Museum of ZZT</a> contains a searchable database of almost all currently available ZZT games, with frequent additions as new games are created and old games are rediscovered. Each game's page includes reliable metadata about the game, a download of the game files, an emulated version of the game that's playable in-browser, and community reviews. The site also features useful guides on how to get started playing ZZT, as well as articles and videos about fan-favorite ZZT games.</li>
<li><a href="https://zzt.org/" target="_blank">z2</a> was the precursor to the Museum of ZZT, and used to be the main fan repository for ZZT games, as well as a hub for discussion. It is still online (though not active), and provides a clear picture of the history of the ZZT community.</li>
<li> <a href="https://zeta.asie.pl/" target="_blank">Zeta</a> is a lightweight, simple ZZT emulator that makes it easy to run the game without needing to set up and configure a whole DOS emulator. It was created by Adrian Siekierka (AKA asiekierka). This is the emulator that the Museum of ZZT uses to provide in-browser gameplay.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/asiekierka/reconstruction-of-zzt" target="_blank">The Reconstruction of ZZT</a> - Adrian Siekierka also reverse-engineered the original ZZT executable to recreate the game's previously-lost source code. This allows for better long-term preservation of the game. It also makes it easier for ZZT game-makers to create their own modified versions of ZZT that can do things the original application never could.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://museumofzzt.com/discord" target="_blank">Worlds of ZZT discord channel</a> is currently the most active place for discussing goings-on in the ZZT community.</li>
