<p>Preserving Worlds is a documentary series about aging virtual worlds, streaming soon on <a href="https://means.tv/" target="_blank">Means TV</a>.</p>
<p>Virtual worlds are delicate things, and they can vanish with hardly a trace. You can archive the offline software, but a dead world can only tell you so much. It’s just as important to document how people spent their time within it.</p>
<p>Preserving Worlds is a travelogue that takes you through some of the most interesting and impactful online games and communities of the past forty years to see what it’s like to visit them today. Along the way, you’ll meet people who are working against obsolescence to keep the communities they care about alive and accessible.</p>
<p>The series takes an ethnographic approach to capture historically important information about the player communities of online video games, as well as some offline games indelibly stamped by the creative contributions of their players.</p>
<p>Preserving Worlds was created by <a href="https://dereklmurphy.com/" target="_blank">Derek Murphy</a> and <a href="https://mitchellzemil.com/" target="_blank">Mitchell Zemil</a>, the filmmakers behind the feature-length surrealist documentary <a href="https://sarasotamovie.com" target="_blank">Sarasota Half in Dream.</a></p>
